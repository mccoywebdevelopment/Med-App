TODO:
Need to fix switch group it does the thing where is pops off
the other dependents again :(

Allow user to be grouped to multiple groups
    -change create user
    -create user


NOTES:
- Need to add groupID to isRemoved right now it's "" b/c the user deselected it (CreateDependent.js FORM)
- Linux nodemon cmds:
    lsof -i tcp:3000 
    kill -9 44475
    
    echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
- Flow for adding user w/ group:
    Create user
    Create guardian
    add to group

    for user registering:
        find guardian by userID if found update guardian else
        create new guardian

OPTIMIZATIONS:
-check if user fields is modified when fetchUpdateUser
-pages (redo models/algorithms)
-send reset password even when user is not yet authenticated.
