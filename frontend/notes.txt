TODO:
FetchGroups in guardian actions is not setting the groupID

FetchGroups in guardian action is being executed twice the first time is the wrong one the second
is the right one. But redux is only showing the wrong one.

NOTES:
- Need to add groupID to isRemoved right now it's "" b/c the user deselected it (CreateDependent.js FORM)
- Linux nodemon cmds:
    lsof -i tcp:3000 
    kill -9 44475
    
    echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
- Flow for adding user w/ group:
    Create user
    Create guardian
    add to group

    for user registering:
        find guardian by userID if found update guardian else
        create new guardian

OPTIMIZATIONS:
-check if user fields is modified when fetchUpdateUser
-pages
