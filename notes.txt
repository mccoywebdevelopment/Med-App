TODO:
- Make test cases
- Run through entire app
- Push to live

OPTIMIZATIONS:
- add urls to user/dependents in group view
- when editing rxsMedication allow the user to exit form like click outside or x icon

ERRORS:
- when editing took on specific date (isAway) sometimes the title of the popUp doesn't show after the user submits
   the view dates popUp.
- fetch groups error 404 when admin loads view dependents

 TIPS:
 - To find all logs/alerts use: 
    ./frontend/src/actions,./frontend/src/components,./frontend/src/views,./queries,./routes,./config
